              Like most girls, my passion for horses started at a young age, but
              didn't really become an addiction until about 10 years ago! That
              is when I was introduced to the sport of reining and was
              absolutely captivated from the moment I tried it. Today, I have
              two reining horses that are being shown. My horse addiction, as I
              call it, is actually the best therapy anything can provide and I
              find solitude and peace everytime I am around these magnificent
              animals.

              Living in Montana and dealing with our climate makes it difficult
              to keep your horses in shape and legged up year round so in 2017 I
              finally took a leap of faith and decided it was time to build my
              own indoor riding arena, so I couldn't make any more excuses not
              to ride. Now, I want to be able to share my wonderful indoor and
              outdoor space with ALL horse enthusiasts. In addition to the
              indoor and outdoor arenas, I also have boarding space available. I
              am currently taking reservations for boarding available June 1,
              2018. Venture out to the North Helena Valley - just a short jaunt
              from I-15 and take advantage of riding in our indoor and outdoor
              arenas. Keep your equine friends legged up all year round so
              theyâ€™re ready to hit the trails or compete in your event of
              choice!
